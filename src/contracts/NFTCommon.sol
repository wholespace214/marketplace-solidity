      is because some NFT contracts implement both the 721 and 1155 standard at the same time. Sometimes, 721 or 1155 function does not work.
      So instead of relying on the user's input, or asking the contract what interface it implements, it is best to just make a good assumption
      about what NFT type it is (here we guess it is 721 first), and if that fails, we use the 1155 function to tranfer the NFT.
